This repo conatins custom spirits for Spirit Island

The spirits contained in this reposetory are compatible with Tabletop Simulator. The easyst way to lode them is [using lua script attached to an object](https://github.com/LokiMidgard/spirit-island-renderer/blob/development/sample/tabletop-simulator.lua). If you attach the script to an object, e.g. a block,
it will add an button to it. Pressing the button will downlad the spirits and setting them up correctly.

The spirits were created with [Spirit Island Renderer](https://github.com/LokiMidgard/spirit-island-renderer)
