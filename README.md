# Spirit Island Custom Spirits

This repo contains custom spirits for Spirit Island. They were created with [Spirit Island Renderer](https://github.com/LokiMidgard/spirit-island-renderer).

The spirits contained in this repository are compatible with Tabletop Simulator. You find them in the [deploy branch](https://github.com/LokiMidgard/spirit-island-custom-spirits/tree/deploy). The easiest way to load them in Tabletop Simulator is to use the included **Spirit Importer**.
Download both [SpiritImporter.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LokiMidgard/spirit-island-custom-spirits/deploy/SpiritImporter.json) and [SpiritImporter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LokiMidgard/spirit-island-custom-spirits/deploy/SpiritImporter.png) and save them in your saved object folder of Tabletop simulator. Normally found in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Saves\Saved Objects`. After that you find it in the [**Saved Objects**](#saved-objects) menu in the game.

The Object allows you to choose which spirits from this repository you want to load. It will then load the most recent version of the spirit.
